  description = <span style="background:red; padding:1px 2px; color:#fff; font-weight:bold;">1</span> TYPO3 and its extensions may write a very large number of information in the log table. This may actually overload your database in a worst-case scenario. Using this feature you can limit the number of logs stored in the database. Every time this limit is passed, a number of the oldest records (10% of maxRows) will be deleted.<br />If you don't want this automatic clean up, set maxRows to 0.<br /><br /><span style="background:red; padding:1px 2px; color:#fff; font-weight:bold;">2</span> All messages come with a level. -1 = information, 0 = ok, 1 = notice, 2 = warning, 3 = error. Set this variable to the minimum level of logging that you want. Setting to -1 will log all messages. Setting to 2, for example, will only log warnings and errors, thus reducing the number of records stored in the database.
